#A fun little project :D

## How to create your app

1. Start designing your server interface
2. Write an integration test suite to validate your work
3. Implement the endpoints

### NPM Scripts

* `npm start`: start the server
* `npm run start-dev`: run the server in dev mode (auto-restart on file
  changes)
* `npm run start-coverage`: start the server and measure code coverage
* `npm t`: run the test suite
* `npm run lint`: run ESLint
* `npm run lint-fix`: run ESLint, applying fixes
* `npm run tsc`: run TypeScript checks

## Where to from here?

Here are some additional things you can do to extend your learning from
COMP1531:

* Create a front-end by learning HTML, CSS and front-end JavaScript. Perhaps
  you could refer to [W3Schools' tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/) or take
  [COMP6080](http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/COMP6080.html).

* Learn [asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)
  online or by taking COMP6080, so that you can get the best performance and
  improved readability in your JavaScript code.

* Use a proper database such as [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

* Implement improved data validation by using a library such as
  [Superstruct](https://docs.superstructjs.org/).

## Thank you

Thanks for taking COMP1531! Now go and make something awesome!
